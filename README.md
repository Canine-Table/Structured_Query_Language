What is a Structured Query Language?
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them. It was created in the 1970s and has become the standard language for relational databases. SQL is used by database administrators, developers, and data analysts. SQL consists of many types of statements, such as data query, data definition, data control, and data manipulation. 
What is a relational database: A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Data is typically structured across multiple tables, which can be joined together via a primary key or a foreign key. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key.
What is a data query: A data query is a request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables. This data may be generated as results returned by Structured Query Language (SQL) or as pictorials, graphs, or complex results, e.g., trend analyses from data-mining tools. A query can either be a select or action query – select queries pick parts of your data, while action queries manipulate retrieved data. 

What is a Structured Query Language used for?
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language for managing data in a relational database. It allows users to define, manipulate, and retrieve data using various commands or statements. SQL is a standard language that is supported by many databases with some extensions. SQL is used to interact with a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) where related tables are connected with relationships that link matching columns known as keys. 
Database Management System: A database management system (DBMS) is a software system that uses a standard method to store and organize data. The DBMS manages incoming data, organizes it, and provides ways for the data to be modified or extracted by users or other programs. Some DBMS examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and IBM DB2.
Relational Database Management System: A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores data in the form of related tables. RDBMS are based on the relational model, which organizes data into one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. 

Who uses Structured Query Languages?
SQL is used by database administrators, developers, and data analysts. It is a standard language that is supported by many databases with some extensions. SQL is used to interact with a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) where related tables are connected with relationships that link matching columns known as keys.

Why are Structured Query Languages important?
SQL is important because it is a standard language for working with databases. It allows programmers to query, update, and reorganize data as needed, while also modifying database schema to control data accessibility. SQL is widely used in analytics, data engineering, and data science to help manage structured data. It is also used to maintain and optimize database performance. SQL is a standard language that lets users combine information from multiple tables based on predefined relationships, analyze this information, and report the results.

What was the world before Structured Query Languages?
Before Structured Query Languages (SQL), databases were managed using file systems¹. The file system approach was not scalable and was prone to errors¹. SQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce after learning about the relational model from Edgar F. Codd in the early 1970s³. SQL was created for getting access and modifying data held in databases¹. Initially, it was called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) but later needed to change its name because another business claimed that name as a trademark¹.

What problem did Structured Query Languages solve in industry?
Structured Query Languages (SQL) solved the problem of managing data in databases using file systems. The file system approach was not scalable and was prone to errors. SQL was created for getting access and modifying data held in databases. SQL is widely used in analytics, data engineering, and data science to help manage structured data. It is also used to maintain and optimize database performance.
